	1. Find one duplicate from array - there is a formula for it.
	2. Mirror of tree
	3. Create a map and sort it by values using lambda and convert to other ds using stream. --> https://javaconceptoftheday.com/java-8-sort-hashmap-by-values/
	4. Given array of ints with duplicate , remove duplicate and find square of elements. --> Sort and use pointers, set, hashmap
	5. Swap numbers with any 3rd variable
	Problem ===> Swapping
	a=12;
	b=14;
	output:
	a=14;
	b=12;

	a=12
	b=14
	a=12+14 = 26
	b = a-b 26-14 = 12
	a = a-b 26-12 = 14
	6. Given a number like 25489 return count of digits in the number - o/p = 5
	int countOfNumbers(int input){
	int count = 0;

	while(input > 0){
		int rem = input %10;
		input = input/10;
		count++;
	}
	return count;
	}

	7. Given 2 array of ints merge them , eg:-
	int[] a = {1,2,3}
	int[] b = {7,9,8,4}
	int[] result = {1,7,2,9,3,8,4}
	8. Given string array as
	Input = {apple,banana,chikoo}
	Output = {a:4,b:1,c1â€¦}
	9. Given a string find out if its valid or invalid
	Valid - [{}],<{[]}>
	Invalid - >{<}, [}]
	10. Find a target value from a rotated sorted array?
	11. Find a peak element from a array where peak means where on left and right is a smaller value than of current. For first and last element its just one element besides them?
	Eg:- {10,20,15,30,90,60} so here 20 and 90 is peak you can return anyone of them.
	12. Given an array with positive and negatives write function to move all negatives at start?
	Eg:- [1,5,4,-9,-3,0]
