What is diff btwn REST and GRPC?
	Sr No	                     REST	                                 GRPC
	1)	          Uses HTTP 1.0 and 2.0	                                Uses HTTP 2.0 only
	2) REST is architecture for designing apis without enforcing. 	gRPC enforces rules by defining a .proto file that must be adhered to by both client and server for data exchange
	3) REST typically uses JSON and XML formats for data transfer.	gRPC relies on Protobuf for an exchange of data
	4) JSON or XML that requires serialization and conversion into the target programming language for both client and server, thereby increasing response time and the possibility of errors while parsing the request/response	gRPC provides strongly typed messages automatically converted using the Protobuf exchange format to the chosen programming language
	5) HTTP 1.1 requires a TCP handshake for each request. Hence, REST APIs with HTTP 1.1 can suffer from latency issues	HTTP/2 protocol, which uses multiplexed streams.
			several clients can send multiple requests simultaneously without establishing a new TCP connection for each one
	6) Grpc is 7 times faster when receiving data and 10 times faster while sending due to tight packing of proto buffer and http2.

Within a test we have interface passed in and we don’t want the actual object and even the mocked object of it? How will we test register then?
What is value object read about it?

DB Bank L2 Interview

	1. Can singleton scope be assigned to prototype? Yes it can be injected -- https://www.quora.com/Can-singleton-bean-be-injected-into-prototype-bean
	2. How can you make below class immutable? How can you handle address here as its reference is coming from outside?
Class Employee{
String name;
Int id;
Address a;
}
Answer :- So from employee getAddress(){ return new Address(a.getPinCode());}
This will return new reference of it and not original one so any mutation in original one by setter of Pincode wont reflect in employee class.

	3. How to create a singleton class and make sure it works in multithreading?
Ans :- synchronized Person(String name, int id){
	This.name = name;
	This.id = id;
	}
	4. What is setter dependency injection?
	5. Take multiple thread and below should be the output?
	T1 :1
	T2: 2
	T3 : 3
	T1: 4
	T2: 5 ….
	Check how to do using wait notify and synchronized here.

	4. Given a array remove duplicates from it?  //could have used set here.
int[] a = {1,3,2,4,5,2,3,2};
int[] output = new int[a.length()];
for(int i =0; i< a.length();i++){
	for(int j = i+1 ; j< a.length();j++){
  	if(a[i] == a[j])

  }
}

	5. Given below implementation of interface how do you pass it to the

}
}

Dell
Round 1
	1. Design a rest api for comments on photo and its db schema design.
		GET, POST, PUT, DELTE with its response code
		https://fb.com/v1/post/id/comment - POST 201 created
		https://fb.com/v1/post/id/comment/id - GET , DELETE, PUT 200 OK

		Post table has - post id , post url
		Comment table has - post id , comment id , comment, parent id , parent type

		Parent type is necessary to identify if parent is photo or comment itself.
		Parent id is to find out parent comment or parent post.
